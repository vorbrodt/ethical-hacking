# What is it?

This is an implementation of backdoor payload, in the form of an executable. The idea is that that the target should click on the executable which will connect to a socket which the attacker has opened. After this the attacker will have full access to the targets file system.

The executable can be disguised as an image to make it more likely the target will click on it. See section "Turning executable into an image".

# Prerequisites

One machine running Kali Linux and another running Windows 10. The attack has only been tested in a scenario where the attacker was using Kali Linux and the target was on a Windows 10 machine.

It might also be a prerequisite that the Windows machine is using English as its default languages, as some languages e.g. swedish showed some difficulties in executing certain commands.

# Step-by-step - running the backdoor exploit

## Step 1

Install pyinstaller if not already installed. PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. To install it run:

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

## Step 2

Next up compile the backdoor payload into an executable with the help of Pyinstaller.

```
python -m PyInstaller .\backdoor_payload.py --onefile --noconsole
```

This will generate 2 files and 2 folders. In the folder called `dist` you will find the payload that we want to send to the target called `backdoor_payload.exe`.

## Step 3

Start listening for connections to the target machine through first configuring IP_ADDRESS and running the following command:

```
python3 server.py
```

## Step 4

Get `backdoor_payload.exe` to the target machine somehow. This could for example be through sending an email to the target.

After the target has clicked on `backdoor_payload.exe` it should take a maximum of 10 seconds before a connection is setup between the attacker and target. The connection can be confirmed through running `whoami` from within the terminal of the attackers machine.

# Post exploit

To turn off the exploit from within the terminal window of the attacker, or open up task manager on the target system and manually turn of the exploit.
